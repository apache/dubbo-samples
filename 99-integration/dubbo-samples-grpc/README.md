## Introduction
**Deprecated!** This demo is for Dubbo 2.7.x gRPC usage only. In Dubbo 3.x, we provide a better and easier way for working with gRPC with the support of Triple protocol. 

Triple is fully compatible with gRPC but more powerful and much easier to use. It is fully implemented by the Dubbo community and has no depend on the Google gRPC-java implementation. 

Please check [dubbo-samples-triple-grpc](../../1-basic/dubbo-samples-triple-unary/) for the basic sample of how to use triple protocol in Dubbo.
